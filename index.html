      <p>
        We will be teaching kids the basics of java that includes initializing
        variable and dening class structures at the start of the summer camp
        to more advanced java at the end which includes Object Oriented
        Programming. We will give practice problems as well as go over them
        every Sunday and we will teach the concepts in depth during the
        meetings.
